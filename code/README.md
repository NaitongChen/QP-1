* `SURE_ridge.py` and `k_fold_ridge.py` contain the implementation of the model selection procedure for ridge regression under SURE and k-fold cross-validation.
* `test_almost_collinear.py` includes the code for running the synthetic regression problem.
* `plot.py` contains the code for generating plots using the results from the synthetic regresion problem.
* `obj_test.py` generates plots of the objective for all model selection procedures as a function of the regularization parameter.
